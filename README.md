# NaiveBayesClassifier
TEXT CLASSIFICATION USING NAIVE BAYES

1) Created a labeled data set (Stock related headline vs. Not stock related headline) from marketwatch.com.

2) Calculate the prior probabilities. 

3) Calculate the conditional probabilities of each word (with respect to both the categories) in the dataset. 

4) Take a sentence as input from the user. 

5) Using the probabilities calculated before and Naive Bayes classification, predict the class of the input sentence. (Calculate the probability of the input sentence being in different classes. The class having the highest probability will be the output class.)
